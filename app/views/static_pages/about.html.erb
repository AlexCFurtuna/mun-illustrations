    <p> My name is Stefan Munteanu and I am an artist and illustrator based in Portsmouth, United Kingdom.
       graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a First Class degree in Illustration.
       Certified in Adobe Visual Design software, such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Some of my current
       projects include book illustrations, childrenâ€™s book illustrations, posters, and prints.
    My work is focused on portraying the fusion of the natural human instinct with the norms and values of society.
    I strive to make enquiries into our decrepit notion of beauty by embracing a style which is foul in its sombre conviction.
    I declare war against the masses, war against the average. I declare war for the sake of war.
    My illustrations exude the ideology that drives me: I do not hide behind the comfortable ordinary,
     nor do I settle with realism. I push my art beyond what pleases the eye or terrifies the soul.
     I shape reality and forge new realms with each movement of my hand.

  <h1>Tools and Media</h1>
  <p>
    I tend to express myself mostly through traditional media but I am skilled in Adobe software as well.
    Both my digital illustrations and traditional ones oscillate between a general monochrome hue and opulent shades from the obscure side of the colour spectrum.</p>
